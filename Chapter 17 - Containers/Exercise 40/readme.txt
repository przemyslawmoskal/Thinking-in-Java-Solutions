Create a class containing two String objects and make it Comparable so that
the comparison only cares about the first String. Fill an array and an ArrayList
with objects of your class, using the RandomGenerator generator. Demonstrate that
sorting works properly. Now make a Comparator that only cares about the second String,
and demonstratethat sorting works properly. Also perform a binary search using
your Comparator.
