Look up the HashMap class in the JDK documentation. Create a HashMap, fill it
with elements, and determine the load factor. Test the lookup speed with this map,
then attempt to increase the speed by making a new HashMap with a larger initial
capacity and copying the old map into the new one, then run your lookup speed test
again on the new map.
