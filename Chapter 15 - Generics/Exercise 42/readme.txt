Create two separate classes, with nothing in common. Each class should hold
a value, and at least have methods that produce that value and perform
a modification upon that value. Modify Functional.java so that it performs
functional operations on collections of your classes (these operations
do not have to be arithmetic as they are in Functional.java).
