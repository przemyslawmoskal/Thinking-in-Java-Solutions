Create a generic class Generic1<T> with a single method that takes an argument
of type T. Create a second generic class Generic2<T> with a single method
that returns an argument of type T. Write a generic method
with a contravariant argument of the first generic class that calls its method.
Write a second generic method with a covariant argument of the second class
that calls its method. Test using the typeinfo.pets library.
