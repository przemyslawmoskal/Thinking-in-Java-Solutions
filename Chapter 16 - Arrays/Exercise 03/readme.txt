Write a method that creates and initializes a two-dimensional array of double.
The size of the array is determined by the * arguments of the method, and
the initialization values are a range determined by beginning and ending values
that are also arguments of the method. Create a second method that will print
the array generated by the first method. In main() test the methods
by creating and printing several different sizes of arrays.
