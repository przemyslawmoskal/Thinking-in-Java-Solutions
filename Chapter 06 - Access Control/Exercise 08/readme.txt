Following the form of the example Lunch.java, create a class called ConnectionManager
that manages a fixed array of Connection objects. The client programmer
must not be able to explicitly create Connection objects, but can only get them
via a static method in ConnectionManager. When ConnectionManager runs out of objects,
it returns a null reference. Test the classes in main().
