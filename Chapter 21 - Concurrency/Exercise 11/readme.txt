Create a class containing two data fields, and a method that manipulates those
fields in a multistep process so that, during the execution of that method, those fields
are in an "improper state" (according to some definition that you establish). Add methods
to read the fields, and create multiple threads to call the various methods and show
that the data is visible in its "improper state". Fix the problem using
the synchronized keyword.
